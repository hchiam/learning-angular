# Learning Angular (not AngularJS)

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Angular comes with a CLI and comes with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Minimal:

Tutorial I'll be following: <https://angular.io/start>

<https://stackblitz.com/angular/anddyavxapb?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts>

Also try [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/):

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-app
cd my-app
ng serve
```

Or triple-click to select this one-liner:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli && ng new my-app && cd my-app && ng serve
```

## Working Example:
