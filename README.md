# Learning Angular (not AngularJS)

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

## Minimal:

Tutorial I'll be following: <https://angular.io/start>

Also try [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/):

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-app
cd my-app
ng serve
```

<http://localhost:4200>

## Working Example:
